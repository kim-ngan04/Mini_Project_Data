# MiniProjects: Data Visualization & Machine Learning on Kaggle Datasets

This repository contains 5 mini projects that integrate data visualization with machine learning using diverse datasets sourced from Kaggle. The projects are designed to run smoothly on Google Colab, leveraging datasets under 1GB.

Each project focuses on a different type of data: tabular, time-series, text, image, and geospatial data, ensuring a broad exposure to various data modalities. The complexity of machine learning techniques increases progressively across the projects, starting from basic regression and classification models to more advanced neural networks and ensemble methods.

Visualization plays a key role in all projects, utilizing libraries such as Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib animations to provide insightful, interactive, and creative views of the data and model outputs.

## Key Features

- **Data Diversity:** Projects cover multiple data types including tabular data, time-series, textual data, image data, and geospatial data.
- **Progressive ML Complexity:** Starting from simple linear regression and logistic regression to clustering, convolutional neural networks, and advanced ensemble or deep learning techniques.
- **Creative Visualization:** Each project integrates interactive or animated visualizations tailored to the data type, enhancing data understanding and model interpretability.
- **Specialized ML Techniques:** Projects highlight unique challenges such as imbalance handling in classification, natural language processing, transfer learning, and geospatial feature engineering.
- **Kaggle Datasets:** All datasets are publicly available on Kaggle and are smaller than 1GB, making them suitable for experimentation on Google Colab.

## General Workflow for Each Project

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
   Handling missing data, data cleaning, feature engineering, and domain-specific preprocessing such as text tokenization, image augmentation, or geospatial coordinate transformations.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization**  
   Employ statistical summaries and creative visualization techniques to uncover data patterns and relationships, using Plotly for interactive plots, Seaborn for statistical graphics, and Matplotlib animations for dynamic insights.

3. **Model Development and Training**  
   Utilize a range of machine learning models appropriate to the data and problem complexity, from baseline regressors and classifiers to deep learning architectures and ensemble methods.

4. **Evaluation and Results Visualization**  
   Evaluate models using relevant metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE, Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC) and visualize performance through confusion matrices, prediction plots, and training progress animations.

5. **Deployment and Sharing**  
   Prepare well-documented, modular notebooks ready for execution on Google Colab, with inline comments and visualization outputs for easy comprehension.
